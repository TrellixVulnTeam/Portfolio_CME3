The brands at the new frontier for digital dating are the apps that once connected singles in the physical world, through digital conversations. With the newly enforced norms of physical distancing, they’ve all similarly pivoted to encouraging video chat dating, making certain once-premium features free, and offering tips on the ways prospective daters can adapt to a digital dating landscape. 

<span class="highlight">Tinder</span> made their Passport feature (unlimited connections with no physical distance restrictions) temporarily free to encourage global romantic connections in our new world where physical distance is more important than ever.

<span class="highlight">Match</span> has launched the ‘Dating While Distancing Hotline’, a free service where daters can chat with a live expert for free about their concerns and anxieties of dating in a digital world.

<span class="highlight">Grindr</span> took a slightly different approach, instead opting to provide dating-adjacent entertainment, such as sharing steamy hook-up stories, inspirational and uplifting content, and even op-eds around the new role of pornography in the contactless reality of quarantine.
Overall, dating app brands are taking a fairly uniform approach to quarantine dating, but the real opportunities will likely lie in the uncharted territories of the post-COVID world.

The Post-COVID 19 World Will Be More Online Than Ever Before
Once things begin to return to a semblance of normalcy, the hesitations around meeting new people in the physical world will likely linger for some time. We could see an increase in people going through additional measures to vet their matches before meeting up in person, and an even greater scrutiny on the locations and activities they’re willing to do until the dust truly settles.

This discerning approach to potential romantic partners may have even longer lasting effects. One possibility is a rise in pre-date video chats where people get a sense of whether a match is worth leaving the house for. While this may be especially useful in the immediate post-COVID future, it may continue to be a useful tactic for busy business professionals whose time and energy is at a premium; avoiding wasting valuable time and money meeting with someone who turns out to be entirely incompatible.

For brands in the business of dating technology, creating social content around these new rules of engagement, and giving them creative tools to navigate this new dating landscape could help alleviate some of those anxieties.
