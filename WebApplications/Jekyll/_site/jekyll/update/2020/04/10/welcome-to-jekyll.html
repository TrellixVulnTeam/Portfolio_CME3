<h1>How to Be OK With Being Alone Right Now</h1>

<p>Being comfortable by yourself is hard, especially during this pandemic—but there are ways to make it feel a little easier.</p>

<p>Social distancing and sheltering in place during a pandemic is a big emotional undertaking, even if you live with someone you absolutely adore.</p>

<p>It can be even more difficult if you’re doing it alone, especially if you wish you weren’t. Like, Oh, you don’t like working from home alongside your significant other? Cool—I’m worried about not touching another human for the next three months and dying alone, but go off, I guess!!!</p>

<p>Being comfortable being alone is really hard—especially in these circumstances—but it’s also a skill you can cultivate (even in these circumstances). If you’re social distancing alone right now and hating it, here are some ways to navigate the biggest challenges, and some tips to keep in mind over the coming weeks.</p>

<div class="introduction">Make a distinction being alone, loneliness, and solitude.</div>

<p>There’s definitely overlap between these three concepts, but they have different solutions, and it’s helpful to know what you’re working with.</p>

<p>Being alone, generally speaking, means being physically by yourself. (If you live with a roommate who you’re not really friends with, or you are dating someone but they aren’t nearby, you may feel like you are functionally alone right now, and might also find this article helpful.)</p>

<p>Loneliness is a feeling that can set in regardless of how alone you are. It often feels like not really being known: not having anyone to talk to in your city, at your new job, from your couch in quarantine, and/or not having a deep-shallow person who you can be totally yourself with and talk to about every little mundane detail of your day. Humans ultimately need some social connection to feel good and right—even humans who are comfortable with a lot of alone time—so it’s important to be proactive in addressing any loneliness you’re feeling right now.</p>

<p>Solitude is what Lead Yourself First authors Raymond Kethledge and Michael Erwin define as “a subjective state of mind in which the mind, isolated from input from other minds, works through a problem on its own.” Solitude is about being truly alone with your thoughts—so, not being on your phone or in conversation with other people, not texting or tweeting constantly, not even watching TV or reading a book.</p>

<p>The capacity for solitude is naturally inhibited by loneliness, which is why it’s important to think about both right now. The good news is that solitude is a buildable skill. So if you dread being physically alone (or not having your phone on you), or worry that not having a relationship or a friend group says something about you or your overall worth, solitude might be the thing to get “good” at. (More on how to do this in a bit.)</p>

<div class="introduction">If you’re feeling lonely, tell people that.</div>

<p>It can be hard to be vulnerable with other people, but if there was ever a time… it’s this moment, when we’re literally all vulnerable. You’re definitely not the only person who’s figuring out how to be away from others right now, and telling people that can be a huge relief, make it possible for them to step in and show up for you, and demonstrate to those you care about that they’re allowed and encouraged to talk about these things if they’re feeling them, too.</p>

<p>You might be surprised by how many people will be more responsive to a clear expression of a feeling versus you trying to “show” that you’re lonely in indirect ways (“I’m so bored lmao haven’t talked to anyone in days”). So often, our needs aren’t nearly as obvious as we think they are; if you haven’t used the word “lonely” yet, make a point to do that ASAP.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/blog-renzepensert/assets/blog.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<div class="introduction">When it comes to communication, prioritize quality over quantity.</div>

<p>You might be tempted to spend a lot of time on social media, where, theoretically, there are always people to “talk to.” But passively receiving updates and interacting in small snippets with loose acquaintances takes time and energy that might be better spent deepening more established relationships (even relatively new ones). Part of building the solitude skill is learning to deal more directly with loneliness, so you can create space for yourself to comfortably be alone, in actual solitude.</p>

<p>Instead of logging onto Facebook or sending a mass text every time you feel lonely, think about the two or five or 10 people who really matter to you, and make it a priority to connect with them via a phone call, FaceTime, or Zoom happy hour in the coming weeks. These conversations can be short and don’t have to be deep or serious to be “meaningful.” Joking around and shooting the shit with your co-worker pals can go a long way. (And if you still have time for social media conversations after this, great!)</p>

<p>It’s also worth considering how creating content—status updates, IG stories, tweets, texts—can stand in the way of feeling OK with solitude. The more you post, the more responses you’re going to get… which is going to lead to spending more time on apps overall. You’re not really alone with your thoughts, observations, and experiences—aka, experiencing solitude—when you’re posting, so pausing your output for an hour or a half-day can be another effective way to practice feeling chill with being on your own.</p>
